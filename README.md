# Classification_of_lung_diseases
This project presents a deep learning solution to classify lung diseases, including lung cancer, pneumonia, and COVID-19, using chest CT scans. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate and efficient medical image analysis. It achieves remarkable results, with a training accuracy of 99.85% and testing accuracy of 100%, addressing critical diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings.

The project aims to:

Support radiologists by automating the classification of medical images.
Reduce diagnostic delays in under-resourced healthcare systems.
Enhance patient care by enabling early and precise detection of lung diseases.
This repository includes the CNN architecture, datasets used, preprocessing pipeline, and results showcasing the model's exceptional performance.

Key Features:

Multi-class classification for lung cancer, pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal CT images.
Extensive preprocessing steps for robust and unbiased model training.
Scalable design adaptable to other medical imaging tasks.
